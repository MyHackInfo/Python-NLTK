# Accessing Text Corpora

'''
As just mentioned, a text corpus is a large body of text. Many corpora are designed to
contain a careful balance of material in one or more genres

Corpora like doctor, scientist,etc.

# Gutenberg Corpus:>
NLTK includes a small selection of texts from the Project Gutenberg electronic text
archive, which contains some 25,000 free electronic books, hosted at http://www.gu
tenberg.org/. We begin by getting the Python interpreter to load the NLTK package,
then ask to see nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids()

Most NLTK corpus readers include a variety of access methods apart
from words(), raw(), and sents().

'''

import nltk
print(nltk.corpus.gutenberg.fileids())

#lets take one of them
emma = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.words('austen-emma.txt')
emma_raw = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw('austen-emma.txt')
emma_sents = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.sents('austen-emma.txt')
print("length of austen-emma.txt",len(emma))
print("length of raw austen-emma.txt",len(emma_raw))
print("length of sents austen-emma.txt",len(emma_sents))



# Web and Chat Text

'''
Although Project Gutenberg contains thousands of books, it represents established
literature. It is important to consider less formal language as well. NLTKâ€™s small collection
of web text includes content from a Firefox discussion forum, conversations
overheard in New York, the movie script of Pirates of the Carribean, personal advertisements,
and wine reviews

'''
from nltk.corpus import webtext
for fileid in webtext.fileids():
    print(fileid, webtext.raw(fileid)[:65],'....')


from nltk.corpus import nps_chat
chatroom = nps_chat.posts('10-19-20s_706posts.xml')
print(chatroom)
